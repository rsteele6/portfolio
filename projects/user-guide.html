							<h2>User manual</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>This is a user guide for my employer's dev portal, covering all features and functionality. It's continually updated as required.
						</p>
						<h3>Problem</h3>
						<p>
							My employer, a Boston-area software company, previously did not have user documentation for its dev portal. The portal allows developers to request 
							sandbox/production access to the company's product, reset client secrets, and view documentation. As a result, customer service and support staff were
							fielding redundant questions via email and support tickets.
						</p>
						<h3>Contribution</h3>
						<p>
							I worked with internal developers, SMEs, and marketing specialists to draft the first iteration of a comprehensive user manual covering all features. This
							is a living document that is updated by all members of the docs team as new releases come out.
						</p>
						<h3>Impact</h3>
						<p>
							Support tickets and emails with routine questions regarding the portal were reduced, and the company received several complements from customers.
						</p>
